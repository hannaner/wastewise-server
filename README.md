# Wastewise
Wastewise helps you keep track of groceries and minimize food waste.

I was inspired by my own need when I noticed ingredients spoiling in the fridge that I bought eagerly 2 weeks ago thinking that I was going to cook an elaborate dish, only to be neglected to the trash. Self-reminder to be mindful what you're putting in your basket when grocery shopping on an empty stomach hehe. 

Zooming out to food waste stats in the US, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture stated that food waste is estimated to be 30-40% of the entire US food supply, equating to about 219 pounds of waste per person.

This project is a full-stack application created independently. Check out the client-side code here: - [Wastewise front-end repository](https://github.com/hannaner/wastewise-client)
